The 1960 and early 1970s were a relatively stable time in the life of the Bekonscot Model Village & Railway. For the fifteen years after 1961 Tom Berry and his staff kept Mr Callingham’s dream alive, but rather than standing still, time moved on at Bekonscot. More modern buildings, cars and trains appeared, reflecting the contemporary world outside.

A turning point was reached in 1976 when the Church Army was approached to assist with the running of Bekonscot. Since 1934 the charity had been one of the major beneficiaries of Bekonscot’s fundraising, and its founder, Wilson Carlile, shared Mr Callingham’s philanthropic ideals.

Just in time for the village’s Golden Jubilee in 1979, a rolling programme of improvements was introduced which saw new scenes added, overgrown hamlets rediscovered and older buildings restored. Notable events included the construction of the coalmine, installation of the Westinghouse lever frame at Maryloo, and the Mk I coach being delivered for use as a souvenir shop.

In 1992, riding on a wave of regained popularity and interest in heritage, the decision was taken to return Bekonscot to its former glory: the heydays of the 1930s. Deteriorating models were rebuild or replaced sympathetically, while others were backdated to their original 1930s styling.

The model railway was completely reconstructed, incorporating the old signalling system into a complex computer-controlled network, all of which was housed in a brand-new replica signalbox. Read more about the railway’s history. Where ugly, hastily-built concrete buildings had once stood, quintessential English scenes of 1930s life reappeared.

Seen through 21st century eyes it is perhaps best to see the village in the context of its history, as it stubbornly refuses to modernise. Bekonscot has done what we would all like to do: it has never aged and it has never really grown up. Bekonscot is truly a little piece of history that is forever England; we hope that Mr Callingham would be proud!
