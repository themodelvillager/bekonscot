Bekonscot Model Village and Railway is the world’s oldest original model village. It’s a tourist attraction near London, in Beaconsfield, Bucks.

It was opened in 1929 and it’s a great place to bring the family and stomp around like giants! There are six model towns, a huge Gauge 1 model garden railway, ride-on railway, remote-controlled boats, castles, lakes and industries in 1.5 acres of award-winning gardens.

It's a great family day out, and it's your chance to be a giant in a miniature land of adventure, hidden away in a 1930s timewarp. It’s a big day out full of really nice small things and we'd love to see you soon!
