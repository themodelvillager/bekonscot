title: Models and Attractions
intro: Bekonscot is famed for our little model houses, moving models and incredible outdoor Gauge 1 garden model railway. But there’s more. Oh yes. We’ve a playground (next to the picnic areas), a super 7.25” gauge ride-on railway, elevated walkway and model self-drive boats. We don’t have any rollercoasters or white-knuckle rides - just a lot of good things for the whole family to do, see and enjoy!
