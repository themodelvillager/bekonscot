Ascot Racecourse is the newest feature of Evenlode, and it’s Race Day! See the ladies and gentlemen as they mill about the enclosures. Along the Top Road you’ll see Davenies School, the Manor House Hotel with its lawns, waterside chalet and waterfalls, and the garden centre too.

Look out too for:

* The village green
* The animated lady cleaning her windows
* The hospital (based on Amersham Hospital) with its patients inside
* The canal basin, warehouse and locks
* Cablecars running up the Gorge every 3 minutes
* Foxhunt across the fields (but don’t worry, our little fox has always outsmarted the riders!)
