Greenhaily is home to Chessnade Zoo, with penguins, elephants, tigers, lions and even a chimps’ tea party! The originals of these models are over 75 years old, having been crafted from limewood by children in the New Forest. Newer ones are made from resin casts to preserve the originals.

There’s a collection of houses formerly from Ramsgate Model Village here, brought back and restored in 2003.

Look out too for:

* Cricket on the green
* Windmill
* Greenhaily Station, based on Beaconsfield’s real station (listen for the announcements!)
* Bekonbury Castle
