title: Bekonscot Town
order: 2
---

This market town is the oldest part of the entire model village. Stride down the High Street and peek over the roofs! There’s a cinema, two railway stations, fire station, four pubs, town square, pier, marina, lifeboat station, and of course, possibly the world’s smallest Marks & Spencer.

Look out too for:

* Terrible, terrible puns for shop names
* Minster Church with choir inside
* Clark College, based on Eton College
* Escapee from the police station
* Working Watermill
