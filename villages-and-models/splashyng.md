The noise of the morris men in the square is only drowned out by the rumble of approaching trains at regular intervals. Goodness only knows how the <abbr title="Women's Institute">WI</abbr> meeting inside the Town Hall manages to keep going with that racket. Take a look inside and youâ€™ll see the formidable Chairwoman lecturing the group!

Look out too for:

* Aerodrome with its planes taking off
* Clifftop tramway
* Beaches, Wychwood Castle and whales in the lake
* Moving Yacht Race
* Alexandra Bridge (based on Sydney Harbour Bridge)
* Working level crossing
* Tudor House with transparent walls
* Elevated Walkway
