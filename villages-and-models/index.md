Bekonscot Model Village actually comprises six little towns stuck in a 1930s timewarp. Bekonscot Town is the biggest, with the others scattered about the other 1.5 acres of gardens. Each has its own character, villagers and features - from coal mines to great castles, aerodromes to farms, docks to cable cars, racecourses to escaped convicts!

There are more than 200 buildings, 3,000 inhabitants, 1,000 animals, hundreds of vehicles and many models move right before your eyes. Stride down the High Streets and peek inside buildings - we've hidden hundreds of tiny details so take a second look!
