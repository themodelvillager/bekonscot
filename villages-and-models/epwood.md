title: Epwood & Evenlode New Town
order: 7
---

Epwood and Evenlode New Town run together these days. Evenlode New Town comprises dozens of little mining cottages, scattered on the hills around Evenlode Coal Mine. It’s a dark, damp corner of the Bekonscot District, and freight trains trundle along the cliff bases with loads of coal.

Look out too for:

* The coal as it comes out of the ground
* The archaeological dig
* The “arts and crafts” and “art deco” 1920s style houses
* The retirement home with its fountains
* The petrol station and workshops
* Polo Match, Epwood Castle and Bodger’s Yard
* Remote-controlled boats to play with!
