This is the famous fishing village, sheltered at the bottom of the cliffs. Itâ€™s always busy in the port, and you can see trawlers unloading their catch on the quayside. 

Look out too for:

* Oil Refinery
* Rockclimbers
* More awful puns for shop names
* Dry docks and repair yard
* And look inside the glass-roofed pottery
