title: Hanton
order: 4

It’s a pretty little hamlet; with lots going on today. George and Anna are getting married at the church on the hill, and the photographer is struggling to keep everyone in order. Perhaps the guests have been distracted by the house on fire behind him… Just down the road is the working fairground, and across the way, a steamroller is finishing off some roadworks. These must be Britain’s longest-running roadworks – the road has been shut since about 1983.

Look out too for:

* Hanton Court maze (based on Hampton Court)
* Country Club
* Enid Blyton’s House, Green Hedges
* Farmyard
